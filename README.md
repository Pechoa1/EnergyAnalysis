# EnergyAnalysis
 
Final Project for IN527. Used XGBoost to fit energy data for the East Coast. The goal of this project was to use data preparation on a large data set and then train and predict the model with XGboost.

Returning to this: the model in the first pass had an "accuracy" of ~56%, when looking at this, there was no hyperparameter tunning implemented in this. An improvement to this project would be to add in tunning.
